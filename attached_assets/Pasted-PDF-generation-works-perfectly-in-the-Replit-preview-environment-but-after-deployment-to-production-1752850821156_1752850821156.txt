PDF generation works perfectly in the Replit preview environment, but after deployment to production, it gets stuck in "Processing..." and never finishes.

**Potential Causes:**

1.  **Puppeteer Executable Path:**
    *   The `executablePath` in the Puppeteer launch options might not be correctly configured in the production environment. In `server/services/pdf-generator-broken.ts`, it's set to use `process.env.PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH || undefined`.
    *   **Suggestion for Replit Agent:** Ensure that the `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` environment variable is correctly set in the production environment. If Puppeteer is installed globally, the path should point to the correct executable. If Puppeteer is installed locally within the project, the path should reflect that.

2.  **Missing Dependencies:**
    *   The production environment might be missing some system-level dependencies required by Puppeteer/Chromium.
    *   **Suggestion for Replit Agent:** Verify that all necessary dependencies for running Puppeteer are installed in the production environment. This might include font libraries, graphics libraries, or other Chromium-related dependencies.

3.  **Resource Limits:**
    *   The production environment might have stricter resource limits (memory, CPU) compared to the preview environment, causing Puppeteer to time out or crash during PDF generation.
    *   **Suggestion for Replit Agent:** Check the resource limits of the production environment and ensure they are sufficient for the PDF generation process. Consider increasing the memory limit if necessary.

4.  **Timeout Issues:**
    *   The PDF generation process might be timing out in the production environment due to slower performance or resource constraints.
    *   **Suggestion for Replit Agent:** Implement a timeout mechanism in the PDF generation code to handle cases where the process takes too long. This can prevent the application from hanging indefinitely. Also, check the execution timeout settings in the Replit production environment.

5.  **Sandboxing Issues:**
    *   The `--no-sandbox` flag might not be sufficient in the production environment, or the sandboxing configuration might be different.
    *   **Suggestion for Replit Agent:** Investigate the sandboxing requirements of the production environment and adjust the Puppeteer launch arguments accordingly. Consider using a more robust sandboxing solution if possible.

6.  **Headless Mode:**
    *   Ensure that Puppeteer is running in headless mode in the production environment. The code has `headless: 'new'`, which should work, but it's worth double-checking.

7.  **Code Differences:**
    *   Double-check that the code deployed to the production environment is exactly the same as the code in the preview environment. Sometimes, differences can creep in during the deployment process.

**Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Logging:** Add detailed logging to the PDF generation process to track the execution flow and identify any errors or bottlenecks.
2.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to catch any exceptions that occur during PDF generation and log them.
3.  **Remote Debugging:** If possible, use remote debugging tools to inspect the state of the application in the production environment and identify any issues.
